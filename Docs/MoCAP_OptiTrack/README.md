# MoCAP & OptiTrack Integration

This folder documents our process for integrating OptiTrack-based motion capture with the LIMObot swarm system.

## Overview

- OptiTrack cameras track each LIMObotâ€™s 3D position in real time.
- Motive software on the MoCAP computer streams this data to ROS2 topics.
- A ROS1 bridge converts these ROS2 topics to ROS1 for use by the LIMObots.
- The master LIMObot uses this localization data to coordinate formation movement.

## Files

- `limobot_mocap_positions.png`: Screenshot of 3 LIMObots tracked in Motive.
- `ros2_topic_list.png`: Screenshot showing streamed ROS2 topics from MoCAP.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Notes

- Make sure the MoCAP machine is connected to the same ROS network.
- Run the `ros2` side of the bridge on the MoCAP computer for best performance.
